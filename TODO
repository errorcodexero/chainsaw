CRITICAL:
	Fix connection problem (like generating print-outs before robot is connected to a driver station or any other solution that might/will work)

	
HIGH PRIORITY:
	- Add in a Control struct that is set by either the panel or the gamepad to make teleop decisions based on user input easier
	- Drive base 
	- Autonomous:
		- Simple one that only crosses the base line


NOT AS HIGH PRIORITY:
	- Fix talon srx initialization: separate address for CANs and accessing index for them in the talon_srx_controls array
	- Logging
	- Add in a way to run runall with bazel arguments
	- Laptop configuration
		-ssh config:
			-Fix the "rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts" problem
			-add "StrictHostKeyChecking no/UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" for robot


NICE THINGS TO HAVE:
	- Expand testing of the different robot modes
	- Log Analysis
	- Clean-up stuff:
		- Deploy script
		- Use enum class more places
		- Use std::array in place of C arrays in several places
	- Clean up panel interpret more
	- Meta IO information
		- Add a function that will discover which IOs different parts use (and make a nice list)
		- Make a data type to talk about different inputs
	
	
LOG LIST:
	-RIO Time			10chars 
	-RIO mode			4chars
	-OI inputs (panel)		50chars
	-PDP currents			120chars
	-Robot Outputs			130chars
	-Robot Inputs			30chars
	-Driver inputs			120chars
	-RIO Connection status and ip	12chars
	-DriverStation outputs		4chars
					488 chars total


Eric's random thoughts:
	-Nav stuff should be a little more collected together
	-Sim stuff could benefit from using Monitor
	-Some of the nav types aren't following the naming convention
	-There shouldn't be seperate "panel output" and driver station output
	-There's a better way to do SLOW_PRINT
